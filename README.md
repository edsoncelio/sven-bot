# Awesomobot - custom audio bot for Discord app

Update Instructions:
  - Add new commands with the same name as the audio file its gonna play;
  - All audios must be in the 'audio' folder;
  - No need to add the new entries to the .help command. It's automated now;
  - Keep it clean;
  - If there is updates to the bot, its manually updated to the server.
 
WIP:
  - Automatic server update;
  - Reduce repetitive code;
